ðŸ’“ ESP8266_PlusSensor_OLED

A simple IoT-based health monitoring project that uses an ESP8266 NodeMCU, Pulse Sensor, and OLED Display to measure and display the user's heart rate (BPM) in real-time.

ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project reads heartbeats from a pulse sensor and displays the BPM (Beats Per Minute) on a 0.96" I2C OLED screen. The data is processed in real-time using the ESP8266 board (NodeMCU), which also powers the display and sensor.

ðŸ“Ÿ Output Display

The OLED display shows:

    A heartbeat waveform (based on analog input)

    Real-time BPM value (e.g., BPM: 75)

ðŸ§  Code Logic

    Initialize OLED display using Adafruit libraries.

    Continuously read analog values from the pulse sensor.

    Calculate BPM using peak detection logic.

    Update OLED display with waveform and BPM.

ðŸ“¦ Arduino Libraries Required

Make sure to install the following libraries via Library Manager:

    Adafruit GFX

    Adafruit SSD1306

    ESP8266WiFi (pre-installed with board)

    TimerOne (optional depending on logic)

ðŸ’¡ Applications

    Basic health monitoring

    DIY fitness gadgets

    IoT-based health dashboards (can integrate Wi-Fi later)

    Educational electronics project for beginners

ðŸ”„ Future Enhancements

    Send BPM data to a cloud platform (ThingSpeak, Firebase)

    Add alerts for abnormal BPM

    Display additional vitals (like temperature with a DHT11 sensor)
